The first part of this assignment is very heavily based on Odest Chadwicke Jenkins and Jana Pavlasekâ€™s presentations given over Graph Search. [Presentation 1](https://robotics102.github.io/lectures/rob102_09_navigation_global_search.pdf) by Odest Chadwicke Jenkins, [Presentation 2](https://robotics102.github.io/lectures/in-class/rob102_09_inclass_bfs.pdf) by Jana Pavlasek. The assignment was created by Joey Martin and Zach Neill. This teamwork is heavily based on the same template used specifically by Dr. Jan Pearce in the CSC 450 Security class.
